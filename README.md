# OpenCVPrograms

The following programs were developed as part of a final year project for RMIT University to understand how OpenCV libraries work and how it can be used in creating non-photorealistic rendering software.

The list below gives a summary of each program:

• **imagetest** - Reads an image and displays it using OpenCV functions

• **greyimage** - Converts it to greyscale and displays the output

• **threshold** - Applies five different thresholding functions to an image and isolates specific regions based on a thresh value

• **pixeldifference** - Gets the total sum of pixel values for two images and computes the difference in pixel numbers

• **readpixels** - Gets the individual pixel values of two greyscale images and computes the sum difference of pixel values between the two images

• **rgbpixels** - Gets the individual pixel values of two RGB colour images and computes the sum difference of pixel values between the two images

## Prerequisites

• Ubuntu 14.04.4

• OpenCV 3.1

• CMake 2.8+
